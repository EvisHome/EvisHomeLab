## About Me

I'm an IT professional with a passion for home automation, DIY, self-hosting and AI. I'm a big fan of Home Assistant and have been using it for since 2019-2020.

My Smart Home journey started along time ago I think somewhere around 2005with having too many remote controllers for my home theater system. I started with a basic setup using a Raspberry Pi and a few scripts to control the system. Over time, I added more and more features, such as voice control, scene management, and more.

Before I moved to Home Assistant I used SmartThings with Webcore, SmartApps and Device Handlers (DTHs), which ran in the Groovy IDE. For some years I was using this setup, with a lot of custom code and a lot of time spent on debugging and just maintaining the system.

Ever since I fully moved to Home Assistant things have been much easier and I've been able to focus on actual home automation, and making things smarter.
