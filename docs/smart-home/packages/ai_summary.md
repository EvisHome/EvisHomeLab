# Package: Ai Summary

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Description:** Frontend controller for the remote AI Log Reporter integration.

<!-- START_IMAGE -->
![Package Diagram](../../../assets/images/packages/ai_summary.png)
<!-- END_IMAGE -->

## Executive Summary
<!-- START_SUMMARY -->
The **AI Summary** package serves as the Home Assistant-side controller for the **[AI Log Reporter Integration](../integrations/ai_reporter.md)**. It manages the scheduling, triggering, and data ingestion of daily system reports generated by a remote AI agent. This package ensures that the heavy lifting of log analysis is offloaded to a dedicated Docker container while keeping the results fully integrated into the Home Assistant dashboard via native sensors and notifications.
<!-- END_SUMMARY -->

## Process Description (Non-Technical)
<!-- START_DETAILED -->
This system runs automatically every morning at 7:00 AM.
1.  **Trigger:** The system wakes up and sends a "Start" command to a remote server.
2.  **Analysis:** The remote server (running a specialized AI Reporter) reads the logs from the past 24 hours. It looks for errors, warnings, and unusual patterns.
3.  **Reporting:** Once finished, the remote server sends a summary back to Home Assistant.
4.  **Notification:** You receive a notification on your phone (and a persistent message in the dashboard) summarizing the health of your smart home.

## Architecture Diagram
<!-- START_MERMAID_DESC -->
The sequence diagram below details the interaction between the local Home Assistant instance and the remote **AI Log Reporter**. The process is initiated by a time-based trigger (7:00 AM) or a manual script invocation. Home Assistant opens a secure SSH tunnel to the remote host (`10.0.0.23`) and executes a Docker command (`docker exec`). The `ai-log-reporter` container processes the logs and, upon completion, fires an asynchronous event (`update_ai_summary`) back to the Home Assistant API. This event payload is captured by a Template Trigger, which updates the permanent `sensor.daily_system_summary`.
